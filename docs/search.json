    "text": "🌌 Welcome to the Chi-Files!\nThis blog chronicles my journey as a data enthusiast, tech explorer, and creative thinker. 💧\n\n\n🧑‍💻 Who Am I?\nI’m a Data Visualization Specialist whose work spans data science, analytics, and storytelling. I transform raw data into meaningful insights that drive powerful decisions. At the intersection of tech and creativity, I explore tools like R (with a special love for ggplot2), SQL, Databricks, and even turn ordinary Microsoft PowerPoints into dynamic storytelling platforms.\nAs a curious explorer, I blend technical expertise with the art of data storytelling. From complex datasets to visual art with ggplot2, I transform data into inspiration and knowledge.\n\n\n🫣A Few Fun Facts\n\n🐱 I lean towards more like “cat”—independent, curious, and always exploring, thriving on discovery.\n🐶 Although if asked, I’m a dog person. Dogs hold a special place in my heart ❤️, and my furry friend is my constant companion.\n🌊 I’m captivated by waves in all forms—from the rolling ocean swells to the invisible rhythms of radio frequencies. Maybe it’s not just waves, but patterns in general that fascinate me, like the elegance of geometric designs.\n🛸 The name “Chi-Files” reflects my passion for mystery, exploration, and the unknown.\n\n\n\n✍️ Why This Blog?\nThis space showcases my discoveries in data, visualization, and technology. Here you’ll find professional insights, personal reflections, and creative projects—often likely featuring abstract art and compelling ggplot2 visualizations. 🎨📊\nThis blog aims to inspire, demonstrating how data can be both functional and beautiful, analytical and artistic. 💡\n\n\n🌊 Join the Journey\nFeel free to explore, share, and connect. Whether you’re a data enthusiast, a curious learner, or seeking inspiration, I hope the Chi-Files resonates with you."

    "text": "🌟 Introduction\nggplot2—the trusty workhorse of R. It’s definitely have been the go-to package for creating stunning visualizations for years. And it’s not going anywhere anytime soon. 🎉\nBut I’ve always wondered: What if my ggplot2 creations could come to life? What if I could tweak a slider and instantly see my charts morph? Enter Shiny—a magical tool to make R interactive.\nI procrastinated for years. I finally jumped in. Thanks to tools like shinyapps.io and shinythemes, the process was much smoother than I imagined. These tools took away the stress of deployment and styling, making Shiny approachable even for a beginner like me.\n\n\n🎨 Geometric Generative Art - Shiny App Experimentation\n\n\nCode\ngraph LR\n    A[Static ggplot2 Plot] --&gt; B[Dynamic Shiny App]\n    B --&gt; C[Published on shinyapps.io]\n    C --&gt; D[Embedded in Blog Post]\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n    A[Static ggplot2 Plot] --&gt; B[Dynamic Shiny App]\n    B --&gt; C[Published on shinyapps.io]\n    C --&gt; D[Embedded in Blog Post]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo dip my toes into Shiny, I created an app that lets you experiment with geometric generative art. Adjust sliders to tweak parameters like rotation, scale, and color, and transformation on coordinate system to see how patterns come to life in real time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis app is more of a personal playground for exploring patterns than a polished product. Feel free to experiment!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎥 From Interactivity to Animation\nAs I played with the app, I wanted to see how parameter changes would look as a sequence. I automated the process to generate frames and stitched them into this animated gif:\n\n\n\n\n✍️ Key Takeaways\nShiny brings interactivity to static ggplot2 visualizations—perfect for both data exploration and presentation.\nTools like shinyapps.io and shinythemes make the process approachable and stylish! I’ve also started exploring newer options like bslib and thematic, which seem promising for even more customization and polished visuals. ✨\nThis one’s probably obvious to seasoned Shiny users. But for me, it was a total lightbulb 💡 moment. Decoupling Shiny app development from the blog itself made everything so much easier, and I wish I’d known this sooner!\nStart with something fun to learn Shiny—because jumping straight into building a business dashboard feels like a much higher hurdle. Experimenting with something playful, like geometric art, makes the learning curve way less intimidating."

    "text": "Have You Heard of the 4-4-5 Calendar? 📆\nIf you’ve worked in retail, you might already know that time isn’t always measured in standard months. Enter the 4-4-5 calendar: a reporting tool that divides a year into 12 periods, each organized into quarters of 4, 4, and 5 weeks. This structure ensures comparability across years by standardizing the length of each reporting period.\n\n\nWhy Use a 4-4-5 Calendar?\nTraditional calendars often lead to reporting headaches🤕, especially when months have varying lengths. The 4-4-5 calendar solves this by:\n\nAligning periods to weeks, making year-over-year comparisons simpler.\nStandardizing reporting cycles, especially for weekly-driven industries like retail.\nProviding flexibility with alternative formats, such as the 4-5-4 calendar, for specific business needs.\n\nThere’s also a sibling version👧🏻, the 4-5-4 calendar, which I personally prefer because it ensures that American Thanksgiving 🦃🎁 always falls within Period 11. In contrast, the 4-4-5 calendar may place Thanksgiving in Period 11 or 12, depending on the year.\n\n\nBuilding a Custom 4-4-5 Calendar in R\nTo create a reusable tool, I developed the create_calendar function. This function takes a year and a calendar type (“445” or “454”) and returns a detailed tibble with dates, weeks, periods, and quarters.\ncreate_calendar &lt;- function(year, calendar_type = \"445\", col_pal = NULL, ...) {\n  if (is.null(col_pal)) {\n    col_pal &lt;- ggthemes::tableau_color_pal(\"Hue Circle\")(19)[c(1:13)]\n  }\n  \n  cal &lt;- tibble(\n    dt = seq.Date(ymd(paste0(year-1, \"-12-01\")), ymd(paste0(year, \"-12-31\")), by = \"day\")\n  )\n  \n  wpq &lt;- switch(calendar_type,\n                \"445\" = tibble(\n                  wk = 1:53,\n                  p = sort(c(rep(1:12, each = 4), c(3, 6, 9, 12, 12))),\n                  q = sort(c(rep(1:4, each = 13), c(4)))\n                ),\n                \"454\" = tibble(\n                  wk = 1:53,\n                  p = sort(c(rep(1:12, each=4), c(2, 5, 8, 11, 12))),\n                  q = sort(c(rep(1:4, each = 13), c(4)))\n                ),\n                stop(\"Invalid calendar type.

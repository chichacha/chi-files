### **🌌 Welcome to the Chi**(χ)**-Files!**

This blog follows my data adventures, tech explorations, and creative thinking. 💧

### **🧑‍💻 Who Am I?**

I'm a Data Visualization Specialist whose work spans data science, analytics, and storytelling. I aim to transform raw data into meaningful insights that drive better decision making. I fell in love exploring data using R (with extra special love 💕 for ggplot2), I also love tinkering with SQL, Databricks, as well as utilizing ordinary Microsoft PowerPoints as dynamic storytelling platforms.

### **🫣A Few Fun Facts**

-   🐱 I lean towards more like "cat"—independent, curious, and always exploring, taking pleasure in discoveries.

-   🐶 That said, if asked, I’m a dog person. Dogs hold a special place in my heart ❤️, and my furry friend is my constant companion.

-   🌊 I'm captivated by waves—from the rolling ocean swells to the invisible rhythms of radio frequencies. I am drawn to patterns especially geometric ones, not simply waves.

-   🛸 The name "**Chi**(χ)**-Files**" represents my passion for mystery, adventure, and the unknown.

### **✍️ Why This Blog?**

This space showcases my discoveries in **data, visualization, and technology**. Here you'll find some professional insights, personal reflections, and likely more of odd creative projects utilizing R in some way. 🎨📊

This blog aims to inspire, demonstrating how data can be both **functional and beautiful**, **analytical and artistic**. 💡

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Chi-Files!

Every great journey begins with a single stepâ€”or in this case, a single post. Really I'm just trying to learn how to use Quarto...

### ðŸŒŸ Why the "Chi-Files"?

The blog name is a nod to my love of mystery, discovery, and exploration. Data can be like an unsolved caseâ€”full of patterns, stories, and hidden gems waiting to be uncovered.

### The Chi-Square Test: Solving Data Mysteries ðŸ›¸

In the Chi-Files, every dataset is a puzzle, and the **chi-square statistic** is our investigative tool to uncover hidden relationships.

The formula for the chi-square statistic is:

$$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$

Where: - $O_i$ = Observed frequency - $E_i$ = Expected frequency - $\sum$ = The summation symbol, meaning we sum across all categories.

### **An X-Files Twist**

Suppose weâ€™re investigating sightings of UFOs ðŸ‘½ across regions:

| **Region** | **Observed Sightings** ($O_i$) | **Expected Sightings** ($E_i$) |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Area 51    | 50                             | 40                             |
| Roswell    | 70                             | 60                             |
| Pine Gap   | 30                             | 50                             |

Using the chi-square formula, we calculate:

$$
\chi^2 = \frac{(50 - 40)^2}{40} + \frac{(70 - 60)^2}{60} + \frac{(30 - 50)^2}{50}
$$

This leads to:

$$
\chi^2 = \frac{100}{40} + \frac{100}{60} + \frac{400}{50} = 2.5 + 1.67 + 8 = 12.17
$$

If this value exceeds the critical value, we may conclude there's **something strange going on in these regions**... but the truth is out there! ðŸ›¸

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

# Create the data
data <- data.frame(
  Region = c("Area 51", "Roswell", "Pine Gap"),
  Type = rep(c("Observed", "Expected"), each = 3),
  Sightings = c(50, 70, 30, 40, 60, 50)
)

# Plot with ggplot2
ggplot(data, aes(x = Region, y = Sightings, fill = Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Observed" = "#4DA1A9", "Expected" = "#FFC145")) +
  labs(
    title = "Observed vs. Expected UFO Sightings",
    x = "Region",
    y = "Number of Sightings",
    fill = "Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    legend.position = "top"
  )
```

The chi-square test reveals mysteries hidden in plain data. Use it wisely, and remember: **the truth is out there!** ðŸ›¸

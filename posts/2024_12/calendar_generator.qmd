### Have You Heard of the 4-4-5 Calendar? 📆

If you’ve worked in retail, you might already know that time isn’t always measured in standard months. Enter the 4-4-5 calendar: a reporting tool that divides a year into 12 periods, each organized into quarters of 4, 4, and 5 weeks. This structure ensures comparability across years by standardizing the length of each reporting period.

### Why Use a 4-4-5 Calendar?

Traditional calendars often lead to reporting headaches, especially when months have varying lengths. The 4-4-5 calendar solves this by:

-   Aligning periods to weeks, making year-over-year comparisons simpler.
-   Standardizing reporting cycles, especially for weekly-driven industries like retail.
-   Providing flexibility with alternative formats, such as the 4-5-4 calendar, for specific business needs.

There's also a sibling version, the 4-5-4 calendar, which I personally prefer because it ensures that American Thanksgiving 🦃🎁 always falls within Period 11. In contrast, the 4-4-5 calendar may place Thanksgiving in Period 11 or 12, depending on the year.
